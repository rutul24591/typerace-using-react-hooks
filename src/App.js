import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; // import useState hook

const App = () => {
  // Set useText state functionality by applying useState hook.
  const SNIPPETS = [
    'Bears, beets, battlestar galactica',
    "What's Forrest Gump's password? 1Forrest1",

  const INITIAL_GAME_STATE = { victory: false, startTime: null, endTime: null };
  const [ snippet, setSnippet ] = useState('');
  const [ userText, setUserText ] = useState(' ');
  const [ gameState, setGameState ] = useState(INITIAL_GAME_STATE);

// There are three aspects to the useState hook above:

//  1. The argument to useState is its initial value. Therefore, with useState(''), we are setting the initial value of userText to a blank string.
//  2. The useState function returns an array of two values. The first one is the current value of the variable that is being tracked in the component state. Therefore, in const [userText, setUserText] = useState(''); , userText represents that current value. It becomes a constant that can be used in the component code.
//  3. The second value returned from the useState function is a function itself. This function updates the paired state variable. So setUserText updates the userText value.
  

  // A useEffect hook could be used to set the document.title in the victory case
  useEffect(() => {
    if (gameState.victory) document.title = 'Victory!';
  });

  const updateUserText = event => {
    setUserText(event.target.value)
    console.log("current user text:", userText)

      setGameState({
        ...gameState,
        victory: true,
        endTime: new Date().getTime() - gameState.startTime
      });
    }
  }

  // Note the double arrow syntax. This sets up chooseSnippet to return a callback function itself. 
  // For example, chooseSnippet(0) returns a function itself, that will end up calling setSnippet(SNIPPETS[0]);. 
  // This is crucial for the JSX, which will update to display the snippet

  const chooseSnippet = snippetIndex => () => {
    console.log('setSnippet', snippetIndex);

    // When the user selects a snippet, this should add a startTime. Therefore, weâ€™ll use setGameState to set the value of gameState.startGame. 
    // Note that when you use the setter method returned from the useState hook, you must provide an entirely new object or value. 
    // Therefore, weâ€™ll create an object that consists of all the current data in the gameState object, using the spread operator. 
    // Then weâ€™ll override the startTime field to new Date().getTime()

    setSnippet(SNIPPETS[snippetIndex]);
    setGameState({ ...gameState, startTime: new Date().getTime() })
  }
